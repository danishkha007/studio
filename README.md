# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    After the installation is complete, start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:9002`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code for errors.
- `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript to check for type errors.
